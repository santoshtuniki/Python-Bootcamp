#### A variable is only available from inside the region it is created. This is called *scope*.

##### Only Local & Global scope.

##### Global scope

    A variable created in the "main" body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope

##### Local scope

    A variable created inside a "function" belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function.

##### Modify global variable from inside the function --- "global" 

##### Any variable created outside the function, whether  Inside a if/else/for/while code block is the same as outside it, i.e considered Globally.

#### There is no *block* scope in Python

#### Use UPPERCASE words to define *constants*
